# Work in progress
Currently uploading the proyect. I'll probably use a LSTM to give a better performance and user experience.

## Some context
The main idea is to simulate something like Xbox Kinect. 
I'm currently using fighting games to test this since they have a 2D camera (Not talking to you Tekken...) and the poses you make can be corresponded to something logical inside the game.

For example, doing a high punch in your room would be the same as pressing "o" to do a heavy punch.
Same goes for crouching and jumping, even tho the last one is a bit trickier.

Be aware that this is a "for fun" proyect and it's not made to win matches at all.
